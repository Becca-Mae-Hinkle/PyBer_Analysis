# Pyber Analysis
## Resources

* Software: 
* Python 3.7.11
* Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6

## Overview

Our client gave us a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas we are to create a Dataframe summary of the ride-sharing data by city type.
We will use Matplotlib to create multiple-line graphs that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We were given access to the data for a 5 month time frame.
We will use this data to inform our client of our complete analysis of his company.

## Results

These charts gives us a better view of the ride-share opportunities in three city types Urban, Suburban and Rural. Urban ride shares makes up more than half of all ride shares. We see that even though the rural drivers make more per ride they are limited on ride opportunities. Urban drivers have more chances at rides and can make up that difference with the increased rides available. The figure below highlights how rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides. Rural cities had the least amount of
drivers, total fares and rides. Suburban cities fall in between the urban and rural cities. Urban cities havec the most amount of drivers, rides and fares.

## Fares by the Week

We have made a table that shows the profit of rides per week. Urban drivers still make more that the urban and rural drivers. I do see a trend where the amount of rides
increase as the climate warms up.

## Total Fare by City Type

The multiple line chart gives us another visual of the trends of rides from January to April. The blue shows that the average fare hovers around $300. It has several peaks throughout the 5 months. The orange had a peak in late February and late April. It falls in between the rural and urban cities and trends in the $700-$1300 range. The Yellow line shows how fares in urban cities totals in the $1600 to $2300 range. March shows the highest trend.

## Summary

Our data shows what kind of fares will be needed based on what type of city they are in. We can confidently tell our client that urban cities are where the money is.
While rural rides have the highest rates they have the lowest amount of rides. I would continue to focus on the urban cities. Increasing the per mile charge in urban cities
would make the drivers happy and earn more revenue. I would also decrease the amount of drivers in urban cities so they can get more rides. Keeping them happy will make you
more money.
